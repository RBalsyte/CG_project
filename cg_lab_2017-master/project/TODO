# CG_project To Dos

- Write documentation
- Add more comments + clean up the code

- Update Scenes (the rotation of the camera depends highly on how often the render() function is called. Everytime I get different results..)

- Create Light 
	- fixed one (Sun)
	- Moving light in the house
	- Light Pole outside the house
	
- Fix shading
- Windows -> transparency fixing?
- Adjust rain drop size, color and speed (partially done.. unless we have nothing else to do)
